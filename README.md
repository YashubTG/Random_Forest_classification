# Random Forest Classifier Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Random Forest Classifier** for a supervised classification task. The model was trained, evaluated on unseen data, and analyzed using feature importance to improve interpretability.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.
- Built a Random Forest Classifier with 100 decision trees using Gini impurity.
- Trained the model on the training dataset using bootstrap sampling and random feature selection.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy score on test data.
- Extracted and ranked feature importance scores to identify the most influential features.
- Displayed the top 5 features contributing to model predictions.
